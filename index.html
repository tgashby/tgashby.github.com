                    Hey there,
                    <br />
                    My name is Taggart Ashby, though I usually just go by Tag.
                    <br />
                    My passion for videogames started when I was child, and I haven't looked back since.
                    <br />
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you'd like to contact me, don't hesitate to email at <a href="mailto:tagashby@gmail.com">tagashby@gmail.com</a> or call me at (916) 949-4933.

                <h3>Sanstorms (2012)</h3>
                <p>
                    Sandstorms was the biggest game I had made up to this point and a huge undertaking. I made my own animation and graphics engine and worked with an actual artist to create the assets.

                <h3>Adrenaline Rush (2013)</h3>
                <p>
                    Global Game Jam 2013 <br />
                    We built a "rhythm" game where you could only move on the downbeat of your heart. There are items that increase and decrease your heartrate that makes the game easier or harder depending on the situation.
                    <br />
                    Full disclose, it didn't quite come out how we had hoped...
