                    Hey there,
                    <br />
                    My name is Taggart Ashby, though I usually just go by Tag.
                    <br />
                    I'm a student at <a href="http://calpoly.edu/">Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, CA</a> working on a blended BS/MS in Computer Science.
                    <br />
                    My passion for videogames started when I was child, and I haven't looked back since.
                    <br />
                    The only game available now is Cargo Nightmare, a 2D third-person shooter. It has taught me so much more than any class ever could.
                    <br />
                    I am currently working on a 2D platformer that should be pretty amazing. I have taken on a lot with this project but that is what of what makes it so much fun :-).
                    <br />
                    Thanks for checking out my site, and I hope you enjoy any games you find here :-).
                </p>
